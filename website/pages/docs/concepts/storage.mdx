# Storage

As described on our [Architecture](/docs/internals/architecture) page, Vault's storage backend is untrusted storage used purely to keep encrypted information.

## Supported Storage Backends

For enterprise customers, HashiCorp provides official support for Consul and Vault's Integrated Storage as storage backends.

Many other options for storage are available with community support - see our [Storage Configuration](/docs/configuration/storage) section for more information.

## Backups & Restores

Due to the highly flexible nature of Vault's potential storage configurations, providing exact guidance on backing up and restoring Vault is challenging.

When backing up Vault, there are two pieces to consider:

1. Vault's encrypted data in the storage backend
2. Configuration files and management scripts for running the Vault server

There's also a big question - what is the error case you're trying to guard against by saving a backup?

### The Big Question - Why Take Backups?

It's important to consider the question of "why take a backup" while developing your ongoing
backup strategy.

We do not recommend backups as protection against the failure of an individual machine or data
center. Vault servers can run in clusters. Vault Enterprise supports replicated clusters for
performance and disaster recovery. With open source features, a Vault cluster can extend across
multiple availability zones within a region.

As you develop a plan for backing up and restoring Vault, include clustering in your plan to
address redundancy concerns.

### Vault's Persisted Data

Backups and restores are ideally performed while Vault is offline. If offline backups are not
feasible, we recommend using a storage backend that supports atomic snapshots (such as
[Consul](https://www.consul.io/docs/commands/snapshot.html) or [Integrated
Storage](/docs/commands/operator/raft#snapshot)).

**If your storage backend does not support atomic snapshots, we recommend only taking offline backups.**

We recommend taking backups **before**, but not during, write operations to the `/sys` API
(excluding the `/sys/leases`, `/sys/namespaces`, `/sys/tools`, `/sys/wrapping`, `/sys/policies`, and
`/sys/pprof` endpoints). Some examples of workflows that write to the `/sys` API are upgrades and
rekeys. In the future, this guidance may change for the Integrated Storage backend.

To perform a backup or restore of Vault's encrypted data when using a HashiCorp-supported storage
backend, see the instructions linked below. For other storage backends, follow the documentation of
that backend for taking and restoring backups.

* Integrated Storage [snapshots](/docs/commands/operator/raft#snapshot)
* Consul [snapshots](https://www.consul.io/docs/commands/snapshot.html)

### Configuration

In addition to backing up Vault's encrypted data via the storage backend, you may also wish to
save the server configuration files, any scripts for managing the Vault service, and ensure you
can reinstall any user-installed plugins. The location of these files will be specific to your
installation of Vault.

~> **NOTE**: Although a backup or snapshot of Vault's data from the storage backend is encrypted,
some of your configuration may be sensitive (a Vault token for Transit Autounseal
or a TLS private key in your configuration, for example). The presence of this information in
your backups will mean that they may need to be carefully protected.
